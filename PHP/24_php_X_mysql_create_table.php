<?php
# creating a table on phpmyadmin
// phpmyadmin provides a GUI to visually manipulate a table
// to access phpmyadmin ensure mysql and apache servers are running on XAMPP, then proceed to this url: http://localhost/phpmyadmin, 
// alternatively, use the admin button on the XAMPP server manager under MYSQL

// the way of creating a database to a table and even populating is very straight forward. Id you need help, I would recommend checking out BroCode, he essentially is a go to for almost everything dev
