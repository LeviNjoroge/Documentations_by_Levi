<?php
// while loops
// the while loop is used to execute some code infinitely as long as a condition is true

// syntax:
/*
while (condition) {
    # code...
}
*/

// NOTE: THE PROGRAM CAN RUN INFINITELY, if that is not your wish, you can add an increment to a counter and use it in the condition for it to have sth it can escape to
