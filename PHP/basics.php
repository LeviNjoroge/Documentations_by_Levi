<!--
    Will be discussing outputs and comments

    Comments are usually added for the following reasons:
        1. Let others understand your code
        2. Remind yourself of what you did
        3. Leave out some parts of your code (Mainly during testing)

    Outputs in php can be done using either "echo" which is the most common
    or using "print".
