<?php
#SESSION
// this is a very important Super Global Variable used to store infomation about the user to be used accross multiple pages/files
// why is it important?
// suppose you want to create a login/signup page for users and you want to display/access their info as long as they are logged in,
// this is great for you since as long as the user is in session, the values stored in the $_SESSION super variable will apply

// to illustrate this, I will create a login and home page
