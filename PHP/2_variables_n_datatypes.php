<?php
    // there are many data types that PHP can handle, 
    // but the fact that PHP is a loosely typed language,
    // means that it is not strict on the data types while declaring and assigning variables

    // to declare a variable, just assign a value to a variable name:
    $age = 20;
    // and just like that you have a variable

    // let us explore some of the datatypes available:
    $name = "Joe"; //string ... note that the value must be in quotations, either double or single is fine
    $age = 20; //integer
    $gpa = 4.0; //Double/float
    $isStudent = true; //boolean => used in conditional testing not in outputs (true=1, false=0)
    $subjects = array("Math", "English", "Swahili", "Social Studies", "Science", "RE"); //arrays => there are three types of arrays, we are going to look into them in details later
    $student
