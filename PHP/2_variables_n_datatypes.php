<?php
    // there are many data types that PHP can handle, 
    // but the fact that PHP is a loosely typed language,
    // means that it is not strict on the data types while declaring and assigning variables

    // to declare a variable, just assign a value to a variable name:
    $age = 20;
    // and just like that you have a variable
