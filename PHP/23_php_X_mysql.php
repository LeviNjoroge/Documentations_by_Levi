<?php
// PHP connect to MySQL database
// PHP allows one to access and manipulate the database via two methods:
# msqli extension
# PDO (PHP Data Objects) - others call it the object oriented method.
                        // most preferred since it can connect to more than just the mysql dtb: eg oracle, postgresql, firebird, IBM, sqlite, FreeTDS, among others
// for this, we will use the MySQL extension since the other requires knowledge of object oriented programming which is beyond the scope of this documentation
