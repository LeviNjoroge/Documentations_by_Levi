<?php
// include()
// what this does is, it copies the contents of a file (html, text, php)
// and includes it in your php file.
// this makes it easier to reuse some sections of your website
// also the changes will only need to be applied in one file

// this highly encourages code reusability 
// and is highly recommended when working with portions of your website that you are going to use the same code on
// examples include:
#navigations
#header and footer files
#database files...
// and many more, the posibilities are limitless!
